# minima-x2
 A Minimal Starter Theme for ClassicPress

Minima X2 is the first ClassicPress Theme with 100% widgetized templates.

You can build your entire Header, Footer, Sidebar using Widgets. The Theme Code itself is kept so minimal in markup and logic,
that even anyone can edit it at free will and change/adapt it further.

The Theme comes with Modernizr.js for optimial handling of any browser compatibility issues, as well it includes a normalise CSS set, and a main HTML 5 CSS set.

Only very few styles are applied for a minimal "good look", in the Theme styles, which can of course be amended thru the Customizr if required.

Since almost every template aspect in this theme is widgetized, you can style and edit it all on the Customizr, if you want, or get your hands dirty and dig into the code.

The Minima X2 Theme is intended as a starter theme, and consciously no further Options and settings have been added.
The clutter and bloat is not what we are after...
